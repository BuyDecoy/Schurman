            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Branden, I am 17 years old and I have lived in Nanaimo all my life. My family has lived in Nanaimo for the past 50 years and because of that I have a lot of connections to people all around. I am interested in all aspects of computer technology including but not limited to the building of computers, exploring different computer software, experimenting with coding languages, and seeing the advances going on in the world of computers.</p>

            <h2><a href="/hobbies.html">Hobbies</a>*</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Recently I have been into camping and while camping I have been able to do some photography & videography. I also love going on road trips and exploring the island but when I feel like staying home, I like to relax and enjoy some video games.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2><a href="/building.html#whatsnext">What's Next?</a>*</h2>
            <br>
            <p>So, what's next? In terms of website design, I think it will stay more of a hobby. After exploring it, I have found it very interesting and enjoyable to work on but when I think about doing it as a career with timelines and with standards to have to follow, it begins to seem like it's not the job for me. Coding this website has allowed me to realize and cement the fact that I really do have a love for technology so I will continue to explore my options.</p>
